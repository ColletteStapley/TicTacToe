# Overview

This is a Tic Tac Toe code written in Kotlin.

This program is a basic Tic Tac Toe game. It starts with a 3-by-3 grid, labeled 1 - 9, and prompts for X's input. The board is displayed after each player chooses a spot until X or O either get 3 in a row(horizontally, virtically, or diagonally) or there is no more places to go(cat's cradle). A winner is declared and you have the option to play again.

This code was written mostly for the purpose of learning Kotlin
